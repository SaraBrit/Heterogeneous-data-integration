Data integration systems help combine information from different sources into a single format. This research looks at the
challenge of merging these diverse data sources, which have different meanings and locations. The goal is to create integrated
systems that convert various formats into one global format and effectively process queries to retrieve information. The
report discusses an earlier study and the implementation of a mediator using a local view approach, focusing on optimizing
queries and evaluating the accuracy of algorithms, achieving a general accuracy value of 70 %
